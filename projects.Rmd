<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text text-justify">All 336 hummingbirds species have
iridescent colours, because of multilayer structures located in their
feathers. But the structures of only a handful of them have been
observed and characterised to date. Yet, the extraordinary diversity of
hummingbird colours and the fact that structures are highly variable in
other groups, such as starlings, suggest that there might be a large
interspecific variation in the characteristics of the multilayer.

<p class="card-text text-justify">
Iridescent colours are widespread among living organisms and
have been the specific focus on many colour scientists and evolutionary
biologists for a long time. However, in spite of this, they have often
be measured in the same way as non-iridescent colours, thus leaving out a
possibly biologically feature: their angular dependency. The main
difficulty lies in the identification of a small number of variable that
could summarise the colour on each point in the angle space. This can be
done using optical theory from physics, which allows us to predict
qualitatively how iridescent colours change with the angle. This reveals
that 6 variables are enough to summarise all characteristics of colours
(hue, brightness and saturation) at all point in the angle space, and
provide a convenient and reliable way to estimate these 6 variables with a small
number of measurements.</p>

<p class="card-text text-justify">The number of colours efficient for communication in a given
environment is limited. Sympatric species that are similar in
behaviour thus likely compete for colours. On the other hand,
common ancestry and camouflage tend to drive colour evolution
towards similar patterns among species. In the tropical
rainforest, many close-related hummingbirds species co-occur.
Furthermore, hummingbirds display a wide range of colours due to
the micro-organisation of their melanosomes. Hummingbirds are
thus an outstanding model to study colour competition and
evolution problematics.</p>

     alt="Male Western bluebird perched on a branch.">
<p class="card-text text-justify">A classic view is that better competitor will exclude lesser
  competitors. It is established that under some conditions,
  lesser competitors can coexist with a better competitor by
  shifting their range or their phenology for example. However,
  the effect of lesser competitors on the superior competitor are
  more rarely studied. Bluebirds are convenient species to study
  this question. Indeed, Mountain bluebirds have recently been
  displaced from their historical range by the more aggressive
  Western bluebirds. However, Western bluebirds colonization seems
  to stop at higher elevation. Which mechanism allow Mountain
  bluebirds to stay in those high elevation areas in spite of the
  close presence of the closely related Western bluebirds? </p>

<p class="card-text text-justify">Lack of data is one of the major issue in ecology and
  conservation sciences. One way to get a lot of data is the
  emergent concept of <em>citizen science</em>. Moreover,
  integrating citizens in the research process leads them to feel
  more concerned about environment and conservation. In this study,
  I analyze data of a new citizen-observatory:

  <li>Prove that the timing of cranes migration depends on
    meteorological conditions</li>
  <li>At short-term, predict the precise timing of the migration
    using weather forecast</li>
  <li>At long-term, assess the effect of climate change on the
