My name is Hugo Gruson, I am an ecologist and an evolutionary biologist. My
research interests focus on species competitive interactions and how they shape
the species current characteristics: geographic range, behavioral traits, color,
etc. My primary focus is on birds but I would be happy to work on another clade
as to me, the topic matters more than the model species.

During my free time, I am always trying to learn new stuff, no matter what it
is: how to build and maintain a bike? How does cryptography work and what are
its applications? What do clouds tell us about the air mass and how to predict
the weather looking at them? etc. I also enjoy a lot being outdoors: biking,
hiking, climbing, kayaking, birdwatching... As soon as the weather allows it, I
go outside, sometimes even before sunrise. Hugo crossing a river on a dead
trunk.
