### Hello world

I'm Hugo Gruson \[*ygo gʁyzɔ̃*\]. I'm primarily an Evolutionary Biologist but I
fell in love with R and package development during my PhD. I am now a Research
Software Engineer in Epidemiology and I can enjoy building tools to facilitate
research of others.

I'm particularly proud about the following R packages I'm maintaining or I've
helped build:

-   [pavo](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo)\*: Perceptual Analysis, Visualization
    and Organization of Spectral Colour Data
-   [lightr](https://github.com/ropensci/lightr)\*: Read Spectrometric Data and
    Metadata
-   [rromeo](https://github.com/ropensci/rromeo)\*: Access Publisher Copyright &
    Self-Archiving Policies via the 'SHERPA/RoMEO' API
-   [mcmcensemble](https://github.com/bisaloo/mcmcensemble)\*: Ensemble Sampler
    for Affine-Invariant MCMC
-   [contactdata](https://github.com/bisaloo/contactdata): Social Contact
    Matrices for 152 Countries
-   [fundiversity](https://github.com/bisaloo/fundiversity)\*: Easy Computation
    of Alpha Functional Diversity Indices
-   [cransays](https://github.com/r-hub/cransays)\*: Creates an Overview of CRAN
    Incoming Submissions
-   [authoritative](https://github.com/epiverse-connect/authoritative): Utilities
    to parse authors fields from DESCRIPTION files and general purpose 
    functions to deduplicate names in database, beyond the specific case of R 
    package authors.
-   [linelist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist)\*: Provides tools to 
    help storing and handling line list data, reporting patient-level data for
    infectious disease outbreaks.

(\* collaborative projects. Please check the full list of authors!)

I'm always super happy to receive feedback about my packages so feel free to get
in touch to talk about any problems you encounter, possible improvements,
feature requests and just tell me about how you used my packages! I want my
projects to be really community projects and not just open-source projects.

But I didn't get started with open-source development with R packages. My
initial involvement in a community project was with [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere), a browser extension to
force HTTPS connection to websites via a manually curated list of rewrite rules.
I started as a happy user who wanted to increase the HTTPS coverage provided by
the extension. I enjoyed the experience of collaborating to build something
great together and continued contributing, until I eventually became one of the
main contributors and then a ruleset maintainer.

During my free time, I also maintain important and understaffed pieces of 
open-source infrastructure, such as the 
[Software Carpentries lesson on "Programming with R"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation), 
or the [CRAN Task View for Epidemiology](https://cran.r-project.org/view=Epidemiology).

#### If I submitted a PR in one of your repository

Below are some things to know if I submitted a PR in a repository:

-   my PRs are just suggestions. Feel free to request any amount of tweaks
    before merging or even to close them if you don't like my changes or if you
    can think of a better way to fix them.
-   in general, I prefer to be asked to tweak my changes myself rather than you
    directly editing on my branch. I think this provides better learning
    opportunities. However, if I left you the technical possibility to do it, it
    means you can go ahead if you think that's a better option
-   I usually try to re-organise my commits in a logical way before submitting a
    PR. Because of this, I strongly recommend you review my changes commit by
    commit. This will be much easier than reviewing all changes at once.
