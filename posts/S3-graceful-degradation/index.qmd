[I have recently published](https://hugogruson.fr/posts/compa-tibble/) a [series of blog posts](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/) on the reasons why one may want to start using object-oriented programming (and more specifically R S3 classes) to improve interoperability with other tools from the ecosystem.

But there are still questions I have not addressed directly, even if they may have been implicitly included sometimes: what makes a good object class? What good practices in class & function design can improve interoperability?

As you can expect from these questions, this post may be slightly more subjective than the previous ones on this topic.

I will argue that it is often a good strategy to inherit from existing standards classes, and to leverage this inheritance relationship as much as possible. In some way, this is the transposition of a common principle in web development that we usually don't talk about in software development: [graceful degradation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation), or [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) [^1].

[^1]: Both design philosophy are often opposed but this debate is not relevant to this blog post. We specifically focus on providing support to both situations, without going as deep as discussing whether the standard classes should be the baseline or the fall-back.

Graceful degradation in web development is the idea that web pages should not require specific recent browser features, but we should always ensure pages are still displayed in a controlled and useful way no matter what, potentially with some bells and whistles off.

I propose we look together today at what this principle may mean in software development, and more specifically in object-oriented programming. If you've never considered this idea, it may sound a bit forced but I think the previous posts would have hopefully primed a little. If you haven't read the previous posts, I would thus recommend you pause reading this post and start with the others.

## Inherit from standard classes

A peculiarity of R is the availability and centrality of `data.frame`s in the base language, whereas you need extra libraries for a similar functionality in most other languages (e.g., pandas in Python).

`data.frame` is one of the first "complex" (in the sense of [non-atomic](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors)) object most R learners will be exposed to and will develop a familiarity with. A good way to leverage this familiarity is to make your subclass a thin wrapper around `data.frame`s.

This means that not only users will be able to get started with your package faster because of this familiarity, but you will also immediately benefit for the huge ecosystem of functions and packages working on data.frames, such as the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org). If you want some examples, this is what we did in the [linelist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist), [pavo](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo), [scoringutils](https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils), and [vaccineff](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/vaccineff) R packages.

In some cases, the output is too complex to fit into a `data.frame`. Even in this situation, I would recommend inheriting from existing, well-established, classes for the same two reasons: familiarity and ecosystem. For example, for the [serofoi](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi) R package, [we have made the decision to inherit from `stanfit` objects, rather than a custom structure](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi/pull/117).

## Rely on parent methods as much as possible

A follow up recommendation from inheriting from standard classes is to leverage their methods wherever possible.

[One of the first](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/60) [changes I made](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/61) when becoming maintainer of the [linelist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist) package was to remove the `rename.linelist()` and `select.linelist()` methods. Indeed, they were, or could easily be, behaving identically as the parent `rename.data.frame()` and `select.data.frame()` methods. Rather than burdening the codebase and maintenance with an extra unnecessary method, it is much simpler and more robust to rely on the well-tested parent method. In fact, the [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_extending.html) explicitly recommends only writing methods for a couple of standard functions (including `[.subclass()` and `names<-.subclass()`), which will enable the use of parent methods directly, rather than writing custom methods for each dplyr functions.

Similarly, many developers have the reflex to write a custom `print.subclass()` method as part of the method implementation. While it may be justified in some cases, it is also sometimes unnecessary extra fluff. My recommendation would be to evaluate carefully what benefit the custom method brings other defaulting to the parent method.

## Enable conversion to standard classes

If after careful consideration, extra metadata makes it too difficult to fit your new class into an existing class, you may sometimes have to define your own class.

But even in this case, you can still apply some principles of graceful degradation. As much as possible, you should provide helpers or methods to enable the streamlined conversion (or graceful degradation) of your method to a standard class.

A good example here is the [epiparameter](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter) package, which provides a complex S3 class built on lists, including extensive metadata about probability distribution of epidemiological parameters.
As such, this custom class cannot be used out of the box in most functions from other packages. [But an `as.function()` method is conveniently provided to enables the conversion of this probability distribution parameters into a density distribution](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/0f805b90f984def4851a78148f1cf44c3d480845/R/coercion.R#L18-L41), which can then be used in functions which expect a `function` object.

## Conclusion

Overall, these tips on graceful degradation in class and function design should help produce a package:

- more easily accessible for users because it uses objects that feel familiar
- more maintainable because a lot of method writing is offloaded to the parent class
- more likely to be interoperable because standard classes are a good way to pass data between functions or packages
