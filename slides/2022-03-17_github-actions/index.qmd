## Why and what to automate?

[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png)](https://xkcd.com/1205/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What if xkcd was *wrong*?

-   Requires to be online & available when the task needs to run
-   Not reproducible
-   [Mental
    load](https://emmaclit.com/2017/05/09/repartition-des-taches-hommes-femmes/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Examples

-   [Automatic download of NPI data and
    mapping](https://hugogruson.fr/semaforos/articles/semaforos.html#map-of-semaforos-over-time)
-   [Automatic update of publication
    list](https://hugogruson.fr/publications.html)
-   [Semi-automatic update of team publication
    list](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epiforecasts.github.io/issues/3)
-   [Automatic forecast generation and upload to a forecast
    hub](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/pull/1716)
-   [Bossy slack bot](https://github.com/epiforecasts/slack_bot)

Good for repetitive, menial tasks.

More time for ~~watching movies~~ focusing on more interesting tasks.

## Benefits of GitHub Actions over alternatives

Most famous automation system: cron

GitHub Actions:

-   Scheduling system (and extra triggers) ‚Üê cron
-   Server to run code
-   Notification system

Automation code is open-source as well

## Syntax

``` yml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Syntax: re-using existing blocks

``` yml
# Workflow derived from https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples
# Need help debugging build failures? Start at https://github.com/r-lib/actions#where-to-find-help
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

name: R-CMD-check

jobs:
  R-CMD-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE: yes
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          use-public-rspm: true

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
        with:
          extra-packages: any::rcmdcheck
          needs: check

      - uses: r-lib/actions/check-r-package@v2
```

## Resources

-   Built-in documentation and GUI: [live
    demo](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19_uk_local/edit/main/.github/workflows/rt.yaml)
-   Workflows for R packages (`R CMD check`, code coverage, pkgdown, etc.)
    available in `{usethis}`
-   Source of inspiration: [`r-lib/actions`
    repo](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples)
-   [GitHub official marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)

## Over to you

-   Do you think you could benefit from using GitHub Actions?
-   What kind of task do you have to do on a regular basis?
-   How can I support you in using GitHub Actions?

## Missing features

-   No way to centralize infrastructure / updates for organisations
-   Difficult to test locally. <https://github.com/nektos/act> looks nice but I
    can't get it to work for complex cases, where I need it the most

## Final words

All automation needs to be done in the context of a reflection on our economic
system.
